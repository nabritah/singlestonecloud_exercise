## This documents details Tasks I was/not able to complete due to time, challenges and learning outcomes from the project. 

### Exercise_1
What I achieved:  
  Deployed code as AWS Lambda function  
  Deployed all infrastructure using Terraform (API_gateway_and_lambda_function.tf)  
  Made function publicy accessible using API gateway  
  Added cloudwatch for observabilty  
  
What I didn't do:  
  No loadbalancer added  
  
### Exercise_2  
What I achieved:  
  Deployed all EC2 webserver infrastructure as code using Terraform (EC2.tf)  
  EC2 instance bootstraps itself  
  
What I didn't do:  
  Create more than one instance (instance)  
  No autoscalling feature added because only one instance  
  No cloudwatch  
  
### Challenges from entire:  
Configuring EC2 webserver to communicate with Lambda API.  
  Did research on how to do this, however, did not find many useful resources so I was not able to complete this task.   
  
Lambda fuction image was hardcoded. Did not achieve the API look.   

### Outcomes  
First project working with lambda functions. A lot of research was involved while doing this project so I learnt a lot while doing it.    

Lambda fuction image was hardcoded. Did not achieve the API look.
